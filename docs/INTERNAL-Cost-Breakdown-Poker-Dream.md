## Pricing Strategy Notes

### Why These Prices?

1. **Phase 1 (Lower Margin):** Community MVP is complex with real-time features - margin is reasonable at 17.5%

2. **Phase 2 (Better Margin):** Enhancement phase leverages existing infrastructure - 24% margin

3. **Phase 3 (Best Margin):** Bankroll app is simpler, reuses design system - 34% margin is excellent

4. **Project Management (Very High Margin):** This is bundled overhead - actual PM hours are distributed across phases

5. **Admin Panel (Good Margins):** Using React Admin framework reduces development time significantly

2. **Phase 2:** Quick wins - leverage Phase 1 infrastructure for high margins
3. **Phase 3:** High margin phase - don't discount heavily

### Long-term Strategy
1. Position for future enhancements (Staking, Tournament Management)
2. Build case study from successful launch
3. Establish as poker/gaming vertical expertise
4. Leverage for similar projects
